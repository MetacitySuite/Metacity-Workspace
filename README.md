# BananaGL

This is a complete rewrite of the original Metacity-Workspace library. After some experimentation, we have concluded, that maintaining the original library is not worth the effort. Instead, we propose to develop a smaller js library which will handle loading and manipulating files produced by the `metacity` package (Python). We will try make it as simple as possible.

Warning: This is a work in progress. The library is not yet ready for production use.
Wish us luck!
