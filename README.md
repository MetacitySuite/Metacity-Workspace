        canvas: canvas, 
        background: 0x495155
    },
    loaderPath: "loader.js",

## History

This is a complete rewrite of the original Metacity-Workspace library. After some experimentation, we have concluded, that maintaining the original library is not worth the effort. Instead, we propose to develop a smaller js library which will handle loading and manipulating files produced by the `metacity` package (Python). We will try make it as simple as possible.

Warning: Work in progress. The API is not stable yet.
